• developer 1

this spits out the console output in the top-left corner of your screen while playing / spectating (may vary depending on HUD of choice)

• demo_debug 1

as explained in the linked post, this outputs everything that happens in the demo, include commands by the player

• con_filter_enable 1

we want to be able to remove all the other junk from the console output about player deaths and unbounded objects and things

• con_filter_text "dem_consolecmd"
